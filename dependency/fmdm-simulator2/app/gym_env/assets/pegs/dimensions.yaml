# [x_dim, y_dim, z_dim, sym_x, sym_y, sym_z]
# sym_x, sym_y, sym_z are the numer of ways the peg can be rotated along the x,y,z axis and look identical
#   a sym value of 0 imples that it is perfectly symmetrical along that axis 
#   i.e. sym_x,sym_y,sym_z is 2,2,0 for a cylinder and 0,0,0 for a sphere
